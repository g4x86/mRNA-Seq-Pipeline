# mRNA-Seq-Pipeline

This repository hosts the pipeline for analyzing the mRNA sequencing datasets for LINCS project.

The pipeline includes two major parts: the first part is the alignment of mRNA sequence fragments to reference genome, and the second part is the comparison between control condition and drug-treated condition to identify differentially expressed genes.
